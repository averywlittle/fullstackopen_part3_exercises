This repo was made for the Full Stack Open Part 3 exercises.
The node app being developed during these exercises will eventually be deployed to Heroku.
I was warned that it's easier to do this from the root of a project repo, so the exercises will live here.

Excited to deploy something like this for the first time.

Here is the deployed app: https://warm-hamlet-90959.herokuapp.com/
